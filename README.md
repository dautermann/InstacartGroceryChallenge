# InstacartGroceryChallenge
This was a demo project for Instacart, delivered to me as a question in HackerRank; where I was given basically an hour to complete as much of the project 
as possible while two interviewers were listening to me try to explain things while I was doing coding.  

The original template app (the code that they delivered to me to fill out) can be found in the 
["original-code"](https://github.com/dautermann/InstacartGroceryChallenge/tree/original-code) branch.  The code that I completed by the end of the 
interview can be found in the ["at-end-of-interview-day"](https://github.com/dautermann/InstacartGroceryChallenge/tree/at-end-of-interview-day) branch.
